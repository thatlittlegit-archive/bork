# börk
A webserver written in Perl. Named after a common theme in
[r/polandball comics](https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball) and after what it was
originally going to be a fork of; [`quark`](https://tools.suckless.org/quark).

## Usage
Run `make` and then `bork`. It takes two command line arguments: `file` and
`tracker`. Enter the file you want to use in `file` and a tracker in `tracker`.
